# Mathematical Foundation of Computing
# ðŸ“˜ Graph Theory Problems in Python  

This repository contains implementations of **fundamental graph theory problems** in Python.  
The goal is to provide simple, clear, and well-documented solutions for students learning **Graph Theory** and **Data Structures**.

## ðŸš€ Implemented Problems  

### 1. Vertex Degree  
- Find the degree of each vertex in a graph.  
- Store results in a dictionary `{vertex: degree}`.  
- Sort vertices by degree.  

### 2. Graph Representations Conversion  
- Inter-convert between:
  - Adjacency Matrix  
  - Adjacency List  
  - Edge List  

### 3. Adjacency Check  
- Given two vertices, check if they are adjacent (directly connected).  

### 4. Complete Graph Check  
- Verify if the graph is complete (every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge).  

### 5. Connected Graph Check  
- Check if the graph is connected (all vertices are reachable from any other vertex).  

### 6. Walk / Trail / Path Validator  
- Given a graph and a sequence of vertices:
  - Check if it forms a **Walk**  
  - Check if it forms a **Trail**  
  - Check if it forms a **Path**  

### 7. Tree Check  
- Determine if the given graph is a **Tree** (connected & acyclic).  

### 8. Spanning Tree of a Cyclic Graph  
- Generate a **Spanning Tree** from a connected cyclic graph.  

### 9. Leaf Nodes in a Tree  
- Count the number of **Leaf Nodes** in a given tree.  

### 10. Binary Tree Check  
- Verify if a given tree is a **Binary Tree** (each node has at most two children).  

### 11. Height of a Node in a Tree  
- Compute the **Height** of a given node.  

### 12. Depth of a Node in a Tree  
- Compute the **Depth** of a given node.
